# Publishing Guide

This guide explains how to publish the `@vvelediaz/react-pdf-viewer` package to npm.

## Prerequisites

1. **npm Account**: Sign up at [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be in a public GitHub repository
3. **Bun CLI**: Install the Bun CLI for building and publishing

## Before Publishing

### 1. Update Configuration Files

#### Update `package.json`
```json
{
  "name": "@vvelediaz/react-pdf-viewer",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/react-pdf-viewer.git"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/yourusername/react-pdf-viewer#readme",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/react-pdf-viewer/issues"
  }
}
```

### 2. Prepare Worker Files

The package includes automatic PDF.js worker setup. Ensure the worker files are properly configured:

```bash
# Copy the correct worker file (automatic via predev script)
bun run copy-worker
```

### 3. Build the Package

```bash
# Build TypeScript and copy assets
bun run build:lib

# Type check
bun run type-check
```

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
# Test the development version (auto-copies worker files)
bun run dev
```

**Important**: The `predev` script automatically copies the correct PDF.js worker file to avoid version mismatches and CORS issues.

## Publishing to npm

### 1. Build for npm
```bash
bun run build:lib
```

### 2. Login to npm
```bash
npm login
```

### 3. Publish
```bash
npm publish --access public
```

## Post-Publishing

### 1. Tag the Release
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 2. Create GitHub Release
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Releases" â†’ "Create a new release"
3. Choose the tag you just created
4. Add release notes

### 3. Update Documentation
- Update README.md with the correct package name
- Add badge links for npm
- Update installation instructions
- Verify all examples work with the published version
- Test zero-config setup and automatic worker management

## Version Management

### Patch Release (1.0.1)
```bash
# Update version in package.json
npm version patch
npm publish
```

### Minor Release (1.1.0)
```bash
# Update version in package.json
npm version minor
npm publish
```

### Major Release (2.0.0)
```bash
# Update version in package.json
# Update CHANGELOG.md with breaking changes
npm version major
npm publish
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Scope not found**: Make sure you've created the scope on npm
2. **Permission denied**: Ensure you're authenticated with npm
3. **Type errors**: Run `bun run type-check` to fix TypeScript issues
4. **Missing files**: Check the `files` array in package.json
5. **Worker file issues**: Ensure `copy-worker` script runs before build
6. **CORS errors in examples**: Verify local worker files are included in build
